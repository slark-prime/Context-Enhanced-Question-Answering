Management provides the committee with regular reports on corporate compliance, significant legal matters, Entergy\u2019s insurance programs, environmental risks, and market and credit risks. Our chief financial officer has general responsibility for risk identification, assessment, and if needed, quantification through the Enterprise Risk Management process. The ERM process is used to manage financial and business risks. Within corporate and business unit groups, we analyze and monitor a full spectrum of economic, environmental and social risks. MANAGING RISKS AT ENTERGY CORPOR ATION, OUR UTILITIES AND EWC We manage and respond to risks differently depending on whether they impact Entergy Corporation, our regulated utilities or our EWC business. For example, Entergy Corporation reduces credit risk associated with the value owed to it by our counterparties through the use of hard thresholds that limit the amount of exposure based on the credit rating of the counterparties. We maintain liquidity risk but mitigate it by ensuring adequate cash and available credit lines, and we utilize a network of U.S. and international insurers to minimize the property and casualty cost of risk. Each of Entergy\u2019s six rate-regulated utility operating companies reduces their individual regulatory risk through filings for adequate recovery, through the use of business processes that demonstrate costs have been prudently incurred and by seeking relief through the legal process when necessary. Entergy Wholesale Commodities retains outage risk related to the power plants that we own, which is mitigated with programs focused on reducing risk exposures, as well as insurance coverage. These programs include operator training, preventive maintenance and equipment reliability, standardized procedures and periodic internal and third-party risk engineering inspections. EWC also manages market and counterparty performance risk with hedging strategies, strict risk limits and reporting, insurance, options and through risk management strategies. BUSINESS CONTINUIT Y PL ANNING Business continuity plans set forth actions to be taken to ensure business continuity and eventual full business restoration following a business disruption. This includes contingency plans for key environmental risks.

In 2009, we created separate long-term targets for \u201cdirect\u201d greenhouse gas emissions and \u201cindirect\u201d greenhouse gas emissions. As we were developing the new environmental targets, we came to the conclusion that it is better to have a common goal and associated target for the two types of emissions. We believe this treats both sources of emissions equally while simplifying the structure of our goals and targets. Thus, we arrived at a common medium-term target for greenhouse gas emissions. New Target By 2020, reduce net emissions by 50% from 2012 total levels Click here for more information about our process to develop the new emissions target.

The 2006 baseline level refers to the total waste generated in 2006. Specifically, this means decreasing our waste sent to landfill to levels below 136,000 tons per year. Despite operational growth throughout the segment, WDP&R managed to successfully reduce waste to landfill below the target threshold. The reduction in waste to landfill and improved diversion rate are due to our combined efforts to increase recycling and donations, and to minimize waste generated. For example: \u2022 \u2022 The Walt Disney World Resort continues to expand opportunities for guests to participate in recycling through the addition of more than 600 new recycling bins on stage, with even more to come. In addition, the Resort continued to reduce waste to landfill through an increased focus on recycling construction materials from development projects. Some of these materials included concrete, steel, and carpet. In May 2013, the Disneyland Resort implemented Phase 1 of a Food Scraps Diversion Program at 60 restaurants around the Resort. Through this effort, Disneyland Resort anticipates that it will divert approximately 5 million pounds of food scraps per year from landfills and process them into animal feed. In 2013, Disneyland Resort also expanded the existing compost collection program at Disneyland Park\u2019s Circle D Corral to increase diversion from landfill.

These assessments yielded a list of specific energy conservation measures, the energy savings associated with each project, the cost to implement and the payback period. saFETY, hEalTh & ENVIrONMENTal sTEwardshIP We have since embarked on those proposals with the strongest payback and energy conser- vation potential. We are also considering the feasibility of additional projects. \u2022 Through temporary (and voluntary) brown-outs and black-outs in our Stickney, Illinois, naphthalene processing facility, we reduced our electricity consumption by up to a megawatt for short periods of time as part of an energy saving demand-response program. \u2022 We installed variable frequency drives on two cooling-tower water-pump motors in our Clairton, Pennsylvania facility. These drives automatically reduce power consumption whenever water flow decreases. This measure is estimated to save more than 578,000 kWh annually, more than five percent of the plant\u2019s total electricity usage. \u2022 At our plant in Stickney, we are evaluating the replacement of evaporators with reverse osmosis systems, which would result in significant savings of natural gas and water while also enabling increased water recycling. Establishing baselines for future energy goals In 2013, we began tracking energy usage normalized for production on a quarterly basis, in order to more accurately assess different energy footprints across our production portfolio. Once refined, we plan to use this data as a tool to implement best energy efficiency practices globally and eventually to set an overall corporate goal for long-term energy use reduction. redUCing energy Use in aUstralia At the Koppers Mayfield plant in Australia, we reduced energy use by 23 percent (and reduced related greenhouse gas emissions) over five years while maintaining consistent production levels. Important elements contributing to the success of this major energy use reduction included: \u2022 Establishing an Energy Management Plan to review usage and energy projects. \u2022 Identifying the optimal operational rate of running as close to 100 percent capacity as much as possible. \u2022 Implementing specific energy savings projects, including: installing variable speed drives on fans and pumps, replacing inefficient air compressors, improving combustion control and recovering heat from boilers and heaters, upgrading insulation, fixing steam leaks, replacing steam traps and upgrading lighting.

Oats COMMITMENT: General Mills will source 100 percent of our oats by 2020 from growing regions that demonstrate continuous improvement against industry- based environmental metrics. Challenges: The supply of oats has steadily declined over the past decades because farmers earn greater profits growing other, more resource-intensive crops. We are working to improve the profitability and sustainability of oat production. Sustainability benefits: Oats are an environmentally friendly crop requiring less irrigation, fertilizer, chemicals and other inputs to grow \u2013 making oats more sustainable compared with other row crops. Oats v Oats are packed with nutritional value, including beta glucan, a source of soluble fiber. have a fibrous root system that reduces soil erosion, improves the soil\u2019s organic matter and increases water absorption, allowing oat growers to rely primarily on rainfall. Oats also are naturally disease resistant, reducing the need to apply fungicides. Strategy: In Canada\u2019s Manitoba and Saskatchewan growing regions, we have launched the Western Canada Sustainability Pilot for oats and other rotational crops, including wheat, canola and pulses (peas and lentils). Progress: This pilot is the result of collaboration with several partners, including Serecon, Pulse Canada, the Canadian Canola Growers Association, CropLife and Ducks Unlimited.

Innovating communities (civic/community involvement, arts) Arrow has a strong history of supporting the arts since our founding eight decades ago in New York. When we consolidated our headquarters in metro Denver in 2011, we established partnerships with the local arts community out of a fundamental conviction that the creative process in the arts and innovation in Arrow\u2019s world of electronics are intrinsically connected. Our innovative support of the arts has a synergistic effect. We guide the artists as they create and express their unique messages to our culture. Our partnerships with art organizations extend this inspiration to about 3 million Colorado residents and visitors every year. Finally, our support of the arts encourages our own 17,000 employees in Colorado and around the world to apply the same spirit of innovation and creativity to their own work and lives.

The QMS engages both our employees and suppliers to ensure our expected product quality. It incorporates policies, procedures and work instructions to direct product development, production and finished device controls, and organizational, environment, document, improvement and risk management systems. Quality at ResMed Each product is developed using QMS procedures for design, verification and validation to ensure they are suitable for their intended use. All of our employees complete training in the areas of the QMS that are relevant to their role. In addition, we train our employees in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), which guides everyday behaviors in a medical device manufacturing operation, such as personal hygiene, protective clothing and documentation standards. Each of our manufacturing departments is internally audited at least once a year \u2013 over 50 internal audits a year \u2013 to ensure compliance with the QMS and to help identify improvement opportunities. Quality with suppliers ResMed draws over 2,000 individual components or materials from over 170 approved suppliers to be assembled in our current product range: see Appendix 2 \u2013 Range of products. We have a comprehensive supplier approval process, with assessment tools that include on-site audits according to the assessed risk of the component or service. We have minimum requirements for supplier communication, responsibilities, quality systems, traceability and environmental aspects. Suppliers are required to have ISO 9001 or an equivalent quality management system, to be certified by an acceptable third party, and to adhere to the applicable Jedec, IPC, ANSI, J-STD and SAE standards for electronic components. In some cases, we may approve a supplier that is not ISO 9001 certified, based on our own audit of their quality system and on agreed and documented controls. Ongoing supplier audits are scheduled according to a supplier\u2019s initial assessment result, their subsequent performance and the nature of the supplied goods. Audit frequency can range from 6 to 48 months, with most suppliers audited every 6 to 18 months. On average, our supplier audit team audits 60-70 suppliers a year. Most supplied components are also inspected before use for compliance against detailed specifications. Corrective actions are specified for any quality defects, escalating through to termination of contract for failure to address defects. Supplier networks We draw from an international supply chain that provides the best quality components and supplies available for an appropriate price. All else being equal, our manufacturing operations seek suppliers from their local economies, however the suitability and quality of our supplies is paramount. To achieve that quality, we seek and value long-term stable relationships with our suppliers. We keep our suppliers informed of our relevant business plans so that they can align their own plans. In particular, we encourage suppliers to develop partnerships, networks and relationships that can support ResMed\u2019s global manufacturing network. Warranties We generally offer one-year and two-year limited warranties on our flow generator products. Warranties on mask systems are for 90 days.

Our company believes in STEM as the most critical element of future economic growth. In keeping with this belief, WEX has proven itself a loyal and longstanding friend to education in Maine, having contributed nearly $400,000 in the past several years to the University of Southern Maine (USM) alone. in 2013 to Additionally, WEX contributed nearly $50,000 educational institutions large and small. The Ferry Beach Ecology School, for example, brings ecology-education programs to thousands of children and adults throughout New England. In the Compass Project, students learn boatbuilding as a way to integrate academic, job, and life skills. The Mitchell Institute, founded by former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, provides scholarships to students attending Maine colleges, and works to remove barriers to higher education. The Maine School of Science and Mathematics educates some of Maine\u2019s most academically motivated high school students. The WEX Leadership and Creativity Event Series was created in 2010 to bring speakers or creative presenters of national or international renown to USM on an annual basis for the benefit of the entire community. In 2013, WEX brought Pulitzer Prize winner and renowned historian Doris Kearns Goodwin to USM, where she regaled a sold-out crowd. The event raised a record-breaking $20,000 to benefit the USM general scholarship fund. WEX also created a STEM scholarship named for education champion Michael Dubyak, to honor his transition from WEX Chairman and CEO to WEX Executive Chairman. The people who can best articulate the impact of WEX\u2019s scholarship support are, of course, the students themselves, who believe that being freed from having to work full-time while attending school has fully opened them to the academic world. \u201cI could focus on my studies,\u201d says computer-science student Rachel Champoux. \u201cI applied for a NASA grant and got to go to NASA\u2019s jet-propulsion lab for the past two summers.\u201d CorporateRegister.com Limited 10-07-14 5 NURTURING AN EXCEPTIONAL WORKPLACE AN IMPRESSIVE 80 PERCENT of WEX employees participated in one or more aspects of WEX LIVINGwell, a unique and comprehensive wellness program that offers everything from biometric screening and nutrition counseling to Pilates classes in our well-appointed fitness center.

With 150 MW of resources currently online, AES Energy Storage operates one of the largest fleet of battery-based storage assets in commercial operation today. The com- pany has over 1,000 MW in development in the US, South America, Europe, and Asia. AES ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT and share with our leadership on an annual basis. As a result of our greater emphasis on transparency around sustainability performance, we are working to expand the set of data routinely collected at the corporate parent level. We believe an emphasis on high quality corporate-wide environmental data enhances our ability to manage and improve sustain- ability performance over time. ASPECT: AIR EMISSIONS Our businesses manage fuel sources to achieve maximum operational efficiency and compli- ance with all applicable environmental laws and aim to manage environmental impacts associated with the fuel sources used in the best way they can, given local conditions. We measure air emissions from our businesses power generation plants and disclose them in our SEC and other regulatory filings, with CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), on our web site and in this first sustainability report. In addition to aiding our pursuit of operational excellence, tracking and reporting emissions data is important to our businesses\u2019 stakeholder communities and environmental regulators. Our businesses take appropriate, practical steps to reduce emissions where possible. Should the businesses be required to significantly reduce air emissions in the future, the investment required to obtain offsets and/ or comply with any future legislation, tax or regulation could be significant. For more informa- tion, please see our 2012 Annual Report Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Our businesses manage air emissions using a combination of power generation plant combus- tion unit and air pollution control equipment (APCE) design, and proper operation of these two systems. The installation of air pollution control systems is primarily dictated by locally applicable environmental laws and regulations. Because air emissions are directly related to the amount of fuel use, each AES business continuously monitors its power generation efficiency and takes action to improve efficiency when necessary. Improved efficiency also reduces both CO2 and other emissions. Our businesses track emissions primarily using continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) and sometimes using operational parameters (e.g., fuel use and appropriate emission factors). The amounts of our businesses\u2019 total emissions are periodically compiled at both the local business and AES corporate levels, and these compilations are quality checked internally for accuracy. Our businesses are required to report air emissions to various local and national environmental regulatory agencies. AES corporate voluntarily discloses air emissions via this Sustainability Report, the Annual Report, our website and other means of communication. In 2012, The AES Corporation\u2019s businesses collectively had the capacity to generate approxi- mately 60 percent of their electric power with renewables or with lower emission fuels, such as natural gas. The gross power generation mix breakdown includes 24 percent from renew- able energy sources and 35 percent from natural gas or highly efficient combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) facilities. Apart from these fossil fuel assets, AES has developed and invests in energy storage and solar, hydro and wind generation businesses, all of which contribute to lowering the intensity of businesses\u2019 aggregate air emissions. \u2022 AES Energy Storage industry leading projects are bringing the next generat"}

As we identify further efficiencies in our stores, logistics, distribution centers and other areas, we will track our progress, set long- term targets and look for new solutions. CorporateRegister.com Limited 16-04-14 Operations 13 ENERGY forging new relationships to advance our efficiency goals As we deepen our energy and carbon-reduction strategies, we have turned to new collaborations to advance our progress. In the summer of 2013, we hired an Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) Climate Corps Fellow who is specially trained to help large organizations reduce their costs while creating environmental improvements. The EDF Climate Corps program began in 2008 and has grown from 7 to 116 experts nationwide, working in both the private and public sectors. Inspiration for the program came from a striking statistic \u2013 40% of all the energy used in the United States comes from commercial and residential buildings. Experts analyze the complexity of consumption patterns to identify the greatest oppor- tunities for new efficiencies. Just as important, they work to connect people from different parts of an organization to align goals. One goal for our fellowship was to lay the groundwork for our own internal collaboration: the creation of a new Energy Leadership Team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Formed in mid-2013, this team includes key decision makers and operations managers responsible for the energy usage at all of our owned and managed facilities, from our distribution centers to our offices, call centers, stores and data centers. The team is focused on both short- and long- term goals. It began by conducting energy audits at key locations, implementing a quarterly review of our energy use and prioritizing new efficiency projects. Its next pri- ority will be creating companywide reduction targets and developing a climate change policy. Over time, the team will develop a renewable energy strategy. A theme running across all of these areas is how to manage our energy con- sumption, even as our business continues to grow. In addition to providing valuable insights into industry standards and best practices, our collabo- ration with EDF helped build momentum to work strategically across our business. In the future, we may once again bring in outside expertise to help develop a renewable energy strategy that will bring us even closer to achieving our long-term goals. \u201cThere is a tremendous opportunity for greater efficiency. Our approach is absolutely win-win-win. Win for the environment, win for business and win for the economy. Companies like Williams-Sonoma, Inc. play a large part in that equation.\u201d \u2013 Sitar Mody, Senior Manager of Strategy for Environmental Defense Fund\u2019s Climate Corps Program CorporateRegister.com Limited 16-04-14 SUPPLY CHAIN helping to lead our industry toward common standards for corporate responsibility Operations 14 As companies work to be- come more responsible, a growing number \u2013 both within and across industries \u2013 are recognizing that they share many of the same challenges and goals. To make faster progress, they are coming together to ex- change ideas, design common stan- dards and invite others to participate in creating change.

In 2013, we announced the following investments: Brazil: expansion of our chocolate factory in Curitiba China: $85 million to expand our biscuit plant in Suzhou India: over $190 million in multicategory facility in Sri City Mexico: $350 million in the construction of a new Biscuit manufacturing facility in Monterey Russia: over $70 million, including $30 million in Novgorod and Chudovo to expand production of local gum brands CorporateRegister.com Limited 06-05-14 2 Fact Sheet 2014 The Call for Well-Being We believe our financial well-being depends on the well-being of our planet. As part of this strategy, we recently unveiled our Call for Well-being, a holistic approach to improve the well-being of the planet and its people \u2013 from farmers to consumers. Our Call for Well-being focuses on four action areas, each with clearly defined goals to make a positive impact on our business and society. Empowering consumers to snack mindfully: We have a two-pronged approach. First, we\u2019re improving the nutritional profiles of our current profolio. Our goal is to reduce sodium and saturated fat by 10 percent and increase whole grains by 25 percent by 2020. Second, we\u2019re transforming our portfolio through new product innovation. We will grow our Better Choice products to 25 percent of our revenue by 2020 and increase our individually wrapped options of 200 calories or less by 25 percent. In addition, we will help consumers make informed choices by providing calories on the front of packaging globally by 2016. Securing sustainable agricultural supplies of key commodities and reducing our environmental footprint: We\u2019re helping farmers create thriving communities with a 10-year, $600 million investment in our Cocoa Life and Coffee Made Happy signature programs. We\u2019re also promoting biodiversity and good environmental practices through Harmony, our successful European wheat-sourcing program. By 2015, we will cut our energy, waste, and water use by 15 percent, eliminate 50 million pounds of packaging and have 60 percent of our production from zero waste to landfill sites. Keeping consumers and our employees safe: By 2015, all of our manufacturing facilities will achieve third-party food safety certification. Investing in communities: Over the next several years, we\u2019re investing $50 million in community partnerships to promote healthy lifestyle programs, focused on nutrition education and promoting active lifestyles. We recognize we don\u2019t have all the answers to these global societal challenges. But through our Call for Well- being, we\u2019re finding innovative solutions by using our global reach to partner with experts to bring together powerful ideas and help execute them at the local level.

We collaborate with customers to deliver customized solutions that help optimize energy use, and provide training for customer operators on how to use our equipment more efficiently. 18% Reported revenue derived from products, services and solutions that demonstrate an improved sustainability benefit over existing offerings.1 1 Detailed information on this data can be found in the Goals & Progress section of this report. With our 320E L Hydraulic Excavator, for example, Caterpillar is supplying customers with a C6.6 ACERT Engine that, along with the Cat Clean Emissions Module, meets U.S. Tier 4 Interim, EU Stage IIIB and Japan MLIT Step 4 emission standards. Even when operating in high-horsepower and high-production applications, the 320E L performs a similar amount of work as our D Series model with significantly reduced fuel consumption. The achievement is delivered through improved engine speed management, integrated engine and hydraulic electronic control strategies, introduction of advanced pump and valve technologies and optimized component selection that deliver customer value and machine efficiency. These strategies deliver class-leading efficiency in the highly competitive 20-ton market. Customers in China are receiving similar benefits from our E Series mini hydraulic excavators, such as the 306E, which combines a higher-efficiency engine with a higher-efficiency hydraulic system. The new Cat C2.6 Turbo Engine has high-altitude capability and provides 15 percent more engine efficiency \u2013 allowing the machine to run at a lower engine speed while delivering the same productivity. In addition, a \u201cflow sharing\u201d high-efficiency hydraulic system provides maximum balance between machine movement, speed and engine power. A standard/power duo switch allows the engine to run with higher fuel efficiency while in standard mode, with the capability of ramping up with additional power when needed for harder applications. Our motor grader product group is delivering efficiencies for our customers by making the Integrated Cross Slope System standard for our new 16M and 24M motor graders. The Integrated Cross Slope System helps operators easily maintain the desired slope by automating the control of one end of the blade. Field testing indicates that Cross Slope allows operators to spend up to 12.5 percent less time to achieve grade. The testing results also demonstrate up to 35 percent increase in average cross slope accuracy and up to 91 percent increase in cross slope consis- tency. These efficiencies translate directly into more sustainable operations. Depending on the model used and frequency of usage of the Integrated Cross Slope System, we estimate customers could save between approximately 350 to 700 gallons of fuel per month, resulting in reduced CO2 emissions. Helping customers reduce their energy and emissions is not limited to advances in our equipment \u2013 it also extends to servicing that equipment as well. Our Filters and Fluids Group in Mossville, Ill., has developed a pair of exclusive and innovative products that address a common equipment touch point: oil and filter changes. Fluid and filter replacement is an essential part of equipment maintenance and by its very nature generates waste, increases the carbon footprint of the machine and is energy intensive. With the introduction of HYDO Advanced hydraulic oil, we now can provide a high-performance, exclusive formulation that triples the useful life of the hydraulic oil, thus reducing waste oil associated with recurring customer maintenance. In addition, a line of Cat\u00ae proprietary filters changes the entire dynamic of filter service- ability: only a filter element needs to be changed while the housing is reused, significantly reducing the amount of waste generated by filter changes. These two products provide customers with substantial savings and sustainability benefits, including reducing"}

Our colleagues further supported our communities by contributing nearly 48,000 volunteer hours over the course of the year. A GOOD FIT | 7 When Associated set out to tell our brand story to the outside world, we wanted to do so in a highly visible and memorable way. For Associated, we elected to choose a bright green chair and the tagline \u201cA good fit.\u201d So why a green chair? The chair represents the customer experience we strive to create through every customer interaction. It is bright and welcoming, strong and supportive, and comfortable and practical. When you think about it, that\u2019s the way we want our customers to feel when they work with us \u2014 welcomed in friendly surroundings, confident in our capabilities and assured that we are always there to support them. Throughout the campaign, the green chair appears in places you might expect, and in surprising places too \u2014 such as an airport, a dance studio and a fishing boat. It serves as a constant symbol that Associated Bank is always there to help our customers no matter where life takes them. It\u2019s our job to fit into our customers\u2019 lives, not the other way around. We chose to use actual customers in our commercials. The stories they share add an authenticity to our advertising that we could never get with actors. Each customer used in our advertisements was recommended by a colleague.

Wendi\u2019s story is wonderful, and it\u2019s just one of many. Through the process of talking to customers in the development of the campaign, we met many who truly enjoy the people they work with at Associated and find value in the relationships they\u2019ve built with us. From personal to business solutions for our customers. relationships, the words of these customers said it more genuinely and authentically than any TV script we could have written. A good fit is also a more intuitive way of expressing the customer experience we want to create.

The journey to introduce our brand began three years ago with the development of a customer-centric business model. The process has been a progressive one, with key building blocks along the way. In 2011, we asked our colleagues to identify any obstacles they believed would stand in our way of delivering on our promise to be responsive, clear and capable. This has influenced how we developed our products and services, designed our processes and procedures, and set our standards for delivering the customer experience. In 2012, we introduced our Customer Promise, giving our colleagues and customers a more tangible sense of what the brand experience should feel like at Associated. W"}

Cabot began studying the Marcellus Shale in 2004 following positive industry results in southwestern Pennsylvania. The objective was to analyze the Marcellus trend across the Appalachian Basin to identify areas with the thickest Marcellus Shale section that also had access to existing pipeline. The Company\u2019s analysis led them to Susquehanna County in northeastern Pennsylvania, where there had previously been only five wells drilled in the history of the county. Since Cabot was the first-mover in the area, acreage costs were low and so Cabot began leasing aggressively. Cabot commenced its leasing efforts in Susquehanna County in 2005 and by June 2006 the Company had drilled its first vertical Marcellus well to test the viability of the play. The result was the discovery of a thick, mature, structurally-enhanced reservoir that exceeded all expectations. Based on these findings, Cabot accelerated its leasing activities in the area and by the end of 2007 the Company had accumulated over 100,000 net acres in this emerging play that would eventually take the industry by storm. Cabot implemented a horizontal drilling program in late 2008 and based on the success of this program, the Company moved to an almost entirely horizontal program in 2010, by which time Cabot had leased its current position of approximately 200,000 net acres in the sweet spot of the play. With a core position established, the Company directed its focus to efficiently developing what would soon become the most prolific natural gas field in North America. TRANSITIONING TO EFFICIENT, MULTI-WELL PAD DEVELOPMENT Since the inception of Cabot\u2019s horizontal drilling program in 2008, the Company has utilized the latest technological advancements to maximize operational efficiencies in its Marcellus operations. From drilling longer laterals with shorter frac stage spacing to testing tighter downspacing between laterals, Cabot has continued to optimize its development of this world-class asset and 2013 was no different. MARCELLUS PROVED RESERVES (Bcf) 4,751.9 3,044.3 2,011.1 1,254.9 Cabot showcased its continued focus on innovation and efficiency 459.0 with its first 10-well pad in the Marcellus during 2013.

Through the introduction of the spill incident rate and working with our contracting community to improve behavior and focus attention on our Core Values, and through the deployment of enhanced preventative maintenance programs for equip- ment and infrastructure, we expect improvements in our compliance performance for 2014. Our Coal Division saw their best year of environmental compliance performance to date, improving over twenty percent each year since 2011. This performance reflects normalization of data for the assets that were part of the transaction with Murray Energy. Reducing our permit exceedances reduces our liability and exposure on a legal front\u2014but it also means we are not impacting the environ- ment. We attribute this to the increased focus on environ- mental awareness, elimination of several historical environmental liabilities, increased training, and the addi- tion of an environmental compliance performance metric in short-term incentive compensation.

Additionally, CONSOL Energy paid $305,250 for prior year consent decrees resulting from effluent limit non-compliances at West Virginia mining complexes. FOCUS ON WATER QUALITY Aluminum is a water quality parameter that we have in our mine water discharge permits (NPDES) issued by the state. We found that in 2012, exceedances of aluminum permit discharge limits were responsible for 57% of our total Notices of Noncompliance we self-report to our state environmental agencies. To address this, we formed an Aluminum Reduction Strategy Team in 2013, consisting of operations and environmental personnel, to review our field approach from construction to water treatment. We reviewed options that included regulatory, operational, and training components. One key source of aluminum is that which is naturally occurring in Appalachian soils. Construction activities can cause erosion, which leads to aluminum showing up in water discharges. We worked with the contractors responsible for site construction and focused training for best practices for erosion and sedi- mentation controls. We also examined the chemical treat- ment process used at our mine water treatment facilities, and began the use of a fish-friendly flocculant for treat - ment prior to discharge.

This in- crease was primarily due to using more natural gas at our California data center, as well as increased heating in our distribution cen- ters because of an unusually cold winter. *Calculation of our GHG emissions is based on guidelines from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. For some of the data, we used estimates, and our GHG inventory may be adjusted in the future. It has not been verified by third-party auditors. *eGrid emissions factors updated from EPA for 2010-2013. LOOKING AHEAD We are continuing to develop a long-term emissions reduction strategy that may include the pur- chase of renewable energy. 2 133k 126k* 2012 2013 BACKGROUND 2013 RESULTS p u rc h as ed EL EC T R I C I TY Aligning business and environmental goals Electricity accounts for the major- ity of our energy usage and cost as well as our emissions. Strategically managing electricity purchases, investing in efficiency projects, and taking advantage of incentives for renewable energy mitigate risks associated with energy volatility. Our initial focus has been to in- vest in efficiency projects such as lighting retrofits in our distribu- tion centers and stores, which has brought significant cost savings. In 2013 we partnered with the Environmental Defense Fund\u2019s Climate Corps Fellows program to identify new efficiency and cost-saving opportunities. We also established an Energy Leadership Team to develop a companywide energy strategy. Our electricity usage totaled 228K MWh*. This increase re- sulted from expanded operating hours at our distribution centers and the opening of offices in Asia. *Calculation of our purchased electricity includes some estimated data \u2013 for example, we estimated energy usage for stores where utilities are included as part of the lease. As a result, this calculation may be adjusted in the future. *2012 estimates revised to include actual data. LOOKING AHEAD We are developing a companywide energy strategy to increase our efficiency and cost savings. 228k MWh 224k MWh* 2012 2013 cata lo g pa p er Continuing our commitment to FSC-certified paper Catalogs support each of our brands and play a fundamental role in our marketing strategy. BACKGROUND 2013 RESULTS pages circulated We made a major shift in 2006 to using FSC-certified paper in our catalogs. In 2007 we achieved the goal of making 100% of our catalog paper FSC-certified. We have also reduced the dimensions of our catalogs and the number of pages mailed, and we allow for customer preferences regarding subscription frequency. In 2008 we formalized our commitment to responsible practices with the publication of our paper procure- ment policy. The number of catalog pages circulated in 2013 decreased by -11.9%*. This decrease is a result of our decision to circulate fewer catalog pages \u2013 an example of how we can simultaneously reduce costs, better serve customers, and improve our environmental per- formance. *Fiscal year 2013 was a 52-week year vs. fiscal year 2012 which was a 53-week year. LOOKING AHEAD We will continue to use only FSC-certified paper in our catalogs.

Leveraging strategies from our programs to increase solid waste recycle/reuse and divert solid waste from landfills, we were able to identify and adopt various hazardous waste management practices and eliminate landfill disposal. \u201c Boston Scientific Corporation has developed very mature and effective environmental management systems under ISO 14001: 2004 at each location. In addition, several noteworthy practices have been observed due to their innovation, creativity and/or effectiveness.\u201c YOKOHAMA FACILITY JOINS GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM In 2013, our new Yokohama, Japan distribution center joined the global sustainability program. The center\u2019s recycling program was substantially expanded, along with a pilot program to re-use some packing materials. Together these resulted in the facility reducing their solid waste rate about 40% compared to 2012.

All of our breweries are located in U.S. states with beautiful natural water sources, and our teams are committed to \ufb01nding ways to reduce the amount of water we use to produce our beer. In 2013 we achieved a 3.7% reduction in the water used to brew a gallon of beer. That number seems small, but when you think about the hundreds of thousands of gallons of beer brewed, every drop helps. Our water usage per gallon of beer is now 4.73 gallons, and an industry-leading 4.07 gallons at our Portland brewery. Our Portsmouth brewery implemented an innovative water reclamation system that allows us to get more mileage out of the water used - at our bottler the water is reused 3 times for rinsing and equipment cooling. It\u2019s amazing when you think about the positive impact that a few simple conservation actions can make on the environment. At CBA, we rigorously track several Key Performance Indicators around reducing our carbon footprint. In 2013 we reduced the amount of natural gas therms used to produce a barrel of beer by 6.3%, putting our overall therms per barrel at 1.67. Additionally, we reduced our electricity usage by 7.9% to 19.49 kilowatts per barrel of beer - through simple measures such as repairing compressed air leaks and upgrading inefficient lights (or even better, completely removing \ufb01xtures in well-lit areas)! Our Portland brewery underwent an Energy Diet in partnership with an Energy Trust of Oregon program to achieve an 8.4% reduction in electricity usage for an industry-leading benchmark of 12.20 kWh per barrel. Our brewery in Hawaii provides 50% of its electricity needs through a cool photovoltaic solar panel system. As an avid supporter of numerous recycling programs across our breweries, pubs and offices, we\u2019re proud to announce that in 2013, we achieved a whopping 99.4% recycling diversion rate at our Portland brewery. Including the truckloads of spent grains, yeast and hops that leave daily to nearby dairy farms, we recycled our bottle caps and malt sacks for the \ufb01rst time, which meant that less than 1% of our trash hit the land\ufb01ll. Additionally,our brewery recyclables in Portsmouth travel less than 11 miles to our manufacturing partner, Poly Recovery, who helps us turn 100% of our plastic \u201crecyclables\u201d into new products such as carpeting, clothing and shoes. The brewery was recognized by the Green Alliance for our zero waste efforts.

Truckloads of spent grain picked up by farmers at our breweries each day and fed to cattle. 5 14 Tons of glass recycled each month in Portland, made into new beer bottles just 8 miles down the road. 9,000,000 gallons of Oregon water offset through our partnership with Bonneville Environmental Foundation 4 Having four breweries distributed across the U.S. gives us the ability to reduce the number of miles we need to travel to get our fresh and delicious beers to consumers. 90% of our grain is delivered in bulk, which creates more shipping efficiency and because most of the journey is via railcar -a transportation mode that is more environmentally friendly \u2013 we\u2019re also being kind to the planet.
