In 2009, we created separate long-term targets for \u201cdirect\u201d greenhouse gas emissions and \u201cindirect\u201d greenhouse gas emissions. As we were developing the new environmental targets, we came to the conclusion that it is better to have a common goal and associated target for the two types of emissions. We believe this treats both sources of emissions equally while simplifying the structure of our goals and targets.
