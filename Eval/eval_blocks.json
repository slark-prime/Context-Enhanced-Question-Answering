Hearing the diagnosis of hypophosphatasia was devastating because at first we \n\nwere told that the doctors could only try to manage his symptoms.

Our study in MG is focused on patients \n\nwith severe disease who are refractory to other \n\ntreatment options. The primary endpoint of the study \n\nis change in a measure of physical functioning in \n\npatients with MG.\n\nAsfotase Alfa: Preparing to \n\nLaunch Our Next Product\n\nThese guiding principles are clearly illustrated in our \n\nasfotase alfa development program for patients with \n\nHPP, a chronic, life-threatening, genetic and ultra-rare \n\nmetabolic disease that leads to progressive damage to \n\nmultiple vital organs, destruction and deformity of bones \n\nand, in too many cases, premature death. Asfotase alfa is \n\ndesigned to address the underlying cause of HPP, which \n\nendpoints. In this case, the U.S. FDA recognized asfotase \n\nalfa as a Breakthrough Therapy for patients with HPP \n\nwhose first signs or symptoms occurred prior to 18 years \n\nof age, including patients with perinatal-, infantile- and \n\njuvenile-onset forms of the disease. \n\nOther Highly Innovative Therapeutic Candidates\n\nBeyond eculizumab and asfotase alfa, our research and \n\ndevelopment programs include additional compounds \n\nwith breakthrough potential. In the metabolic disease \n\narea, we continue to accelerate development of our \n\ncyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) replacement \n\ntherapy for the treatment of molybdenum cofactor \n\ndeficiency (MoCD) type A, a severe and life-threatening, \n\nultra-rare, genetic metabolic disorder that causes \n\ncatastrophic and irreversible neurologic damage within \n\nthe first weeks of life.
